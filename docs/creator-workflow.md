# Creator Workflow

VurctOS starts with AI video because AI video production is creative, multi-tool, repetitive, and easy to lose track of.

The creator workflow should help a user move from reference material to a reusable production pack.

Status: today the creator runs these steps manually with subscription tools. Claude as Orchestrator coordinating them is the target model, not a shipped runtime.

## Core Flow

```text
reference or idea
  -> project brief
  -> input video
  -> frame extraction
  -> video analysis
  -> shot breakdown
  -> image prompts
  -> video prompts
  -> generated assets
  -> publishing captions
  -> final prompt pack
  -> memory update
```

## Creator Role

The creator remains the director.

The creator decides:

- what the project is trying to achieve
- which references matter
- what style rules apply
- which outputs are good enough
- which lessons should become memory

## AI Tool Roles

Claude acts as Orchestrator and assigns these worker roles by stage (see `CORE.md`):

- Gemini can analyze long video context and extract structure.
- ChatGPT can help with creative direction, captions, and prompt writing.
- Claude as Executor can organize files and create local automation.
- Codex can review consistency and implementation decisions.
- Kling, Runway, Veo, Hailuo, or ComfyUI can generate visual outputs.

## Project Files As Shared Context

The project folder is the communication layer.

Instead of copying the full project history into every tool, VurctOS should prepare clean files:

- current task
- project profile
- analysis summary
- prompt pack
- memory notes

The user can paste or upload only what each tool needs.

## Viral Video Analysis

The first flagship workflow is designed to study a viral video and extract:

- hook
- pacing
- visual structure
- shot sequence
- emotional beats
- product or story logic
- caption strategy
- reusable prompt patterns

The goal is not to clone a video. The goal is to understand the pattern and create a new production pack.

## Creative Production Outputs

Useful outputs include:

- shot breakdowns
- image prompts
- video prompts
- visual style notes
- negative prompts
- captions
- publishing hooks
- review checklists

All outputs should be saved back into the project folder.
