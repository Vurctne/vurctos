# Project memory (loaded automatically)

You are Claude acting as Orchestrator for this VurctOS project. Durable memory is imported below. Treat it as known context.

@USER.md
@MEMORY.md

Working rules:

- USER.md is durable user preferences and style memory plus decision patterns. MEMORY.md is project facts, decisions, and what worked or failed.
- To recall older detail not loaded above, run: vurctos recall --project . "<query>"
- After meaningful work, log it: vurctos remember --project . --what "..." --kind decision|style|tool|fail|note
- To consolidate session logs into durable memory: vurctos reflect --project . then reflect-apply after you approve the proposal.
- After significant or repeated work, proactively propose remember entries and skill candidates; when a pattern has repeated and proven useful, scaffold it with: vurctos skill-new <name> --project . (a human reviews the filled skill before first use).
- When the user rejects reviewed work, capture it the same turn: vurctos reject <card-id> --project . --reason "their words" (files the lesson, feeds it to the re-run, re-queues the card).

See AGENTS.md and ORCHESTRATION.md for the full operating model.
