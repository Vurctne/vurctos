# Codex global instructions (VurctOS memory bridge)

This file gives an OpenAI Codex session the same user-level durable memory that a Claude Code session gets from the `@~/.vurctos/USER.md` import in `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`.

Codex reads exactly one file per level at global scope, `AGENTS.override.md` first then `AGENTS.md`, from the Codex home directory (`~/.codex` by default, or `$CODEX_HOME` if set). To install:

- copy this file to `~/.codex/AGENTS.md` if you have none there, or
- append the section below to your existing `~/.codex/AGENTS.md` (or `~/.codex/AGENTS.override.md`).

Do not blind-overwrite an existing `~/.codex/AGENTS.md`: append instead, so your other Codex preferences survive. Some other tools also keep a `~/.codex` directory for unrelated state, so confirm this is your OpenAI Codex home before writing, and set `CODEX_HOME` to disambiguate if needed. To check what Codex actually loaded, start it and ask it to list the instruction sources it loaded.

## VurctOS global durable memory (read before acting)

User-level durable memory lives in two plain files:

- `~/.vurctos/USER.md`: durable, cross-project facts and decision patterns about the user.
- `~/.vurctos/MEMORY.md`: consolidated cross-project memory.

At the start of each session, open both files (if they exist) and treat their contents as known context for every project. They are named here in prose because Codex does not expand `@file` imports.

Do not write to these files directly. Global memory is filed and consolidated only through the human-gated `vurctos remember --global` / `vurctos reflect --global` CLI.
