# AGENTS.md

This repository is the foundation for VurctOS, an open-source, local-first memory and coordination layer for AI coding assistants.

## Project Purpose

Your AI coding tools forget you and do not talk to each other. VurctOS is a small local layer that gives Claude Code and Codex a shared memory, so they stop re-asking and start acting as one team.

It runs on the user's own subscriptions with no API keys, using plain markdown files plus a Python standard-library CLI. The memory and coordination substrate is inspectable files, not a hidden runtime: durable memory (`USER.md` + `MEMORY.md`), procedural skills in the SKILL.md format, and session recall backed by a local SQLite full-text index. The shared memory bridges into both tools (Claude Code via `@`-imports in `CLAUDE.md`, Codex via a prose bridge in `AGENTS.md` since Codex has no `@`-import).

## Current Phase

The project has moved from foundation documentation into building a minimal v1.

v1 is a small, local-first CLI (`cli/`) that handles only the deterministic plumbing: scaffolding a project (`new`), filing and searching memory (`remember` / `recall`, with `recall --stats`), rebuilding the recall index (`reindex`), staging and applying human-approved consolidation (`reflect` / `reflect-apply`, also `--global` for the cross-project memory at `~/.vurctos`), running one board card headlessly against Claude or Codex (`dispatch --agent {claude,codex}`, to `review`, never `done`), re-queuing rejected work with the lesson filed (`reject`), and scaffolding a skill skeleton (`skill-new`). The intelligence (analysis, distillation, review) stays with Claude acting as Orchestrator and Codex acting as an independent reviewer. Keep the same discipline: standard library only, no heavy frameworks, runtime, or package manager, and add code only where a manual step clearly repeats. A continuous dispatcher loop, MCP, and a GUI are still future.

## Required Reading

Before making substantive changes, read:

- `README.md`
- `CORE.md`
- `ORCHESTRATION.md`
- `VISION.md`
- `MANIFESTO.md`
- `ARCHITECTURE.md`
- `MVP.md`
- `ROADMAP.md`
- `docs/subscription-first.md`
- `docs/memory-system.md`
- `docs/skills-system.md`
- `docs/privacy-model.md`

## Brand Rules

- Vurctne is the parent developer brand.
- VurctOS is the open-source personal AI operating layer for AI coding tools.
- Vurctne Skills is the future workflow and skill marketplace.

Use these names consistently.

## Writing Rules

- Avoid the English long em dash character and the Chinese double dash.
- Use commas, colons, parentheses, short hyphens, or new lines instead.
- Keep documentation practical and honest.
- Explain what exists now versus what is future direction.
- Do not pretend future systems are already implemented.

## Safety Rules

- Do not commit secrets, tokens, browser profiles, session files, real personal memory, or account credentials. The full public/private policy is `docs/privacy-model.md`; review staged files before every commit.
- Avoid APIs unless the user explicitly asks for API-based integration.
- Prefer official subscription login workflows where practical and permitted.
- Do not automate websites in ways that violate platform terms.
- Preserve local-first behavior.

## Repository Rules

- Do not delete source files or project documents unless the user explicitly asks.
- Do not overbuild.
- Prefer markdown and simple scripts first.
- Do not add package managers, frameworks, build systems, MCP servers, or GUI code without explicit approval.
- Preserve modular architecture.
- Always update docs when making structural changes.
- Keep project folders readable by humans and AI agents.

## Architecture Rules

- Local files are the first stable communication layer.
- Agents coordinate through the task board and handoff files, not direct messaging.
- The two delegation channels stay distinct: local CLI execution is automated (Channel A); any web tool is human-in-the-loop copy handoff (Channel B). The dispatcher automates only `channel: local` cards, via headless Claude Code or Codex on the user's own subscription login. `channel: handoff` cards always stay human-in-the-loop; never weaken this boundary.
- Dispatch trust model: dispatch runs a card's instructions with edits accepted (prompt-injection by design), so only dispatch boards whose cards were authored or reviewed by the operator, never a third-party board. Document this wherever dispatch is described.
- Workflows should be markdown-first until automation is justified.
- Memory should be inspectable and editable.
- Skills should be reusable workflow patterns, not hidden magic.
- MCP comes later, after local workflows prove useful.
- Plugin and marketplace layers come after the open-source foundation is coherent.

## Agent Role Defaults

- Claude: Orchestrator (the Core Assistant), and as a worker the Executor for code and local automation.
- Codex: independent code and implementation review, consistency checking, and a second executor. Claude never reviews its own execution output; Codex does that.
- Hermes: referenced only as a design inspiration for the three-layer memory model, not a worker and not required.

The canonical role registry is in `CORE.md`; the coordination system is in `ORCHESTRATION.md`.

## Definition Of Done

A change is done when:

- affected documents are internally consistent
- no forbidden long em dash or Chinese double dash characters were introduced
- the repository still reflects a documentation-first foundation
- no full-system implementation has been introduced accidentally
- git status has been checked
